how to
1. Connect wallet (Zora Testnet)
2. Upload your meme (jpg,png,jpeg)

The Community Edition Manager contract will create a new edition (token) on a multi-edition collection, after confirming the transaction you will get the link to the minting site for your meme/nft on Zora.
You also get a Warpcast link with a composed cast ready to post on the memes channel.
