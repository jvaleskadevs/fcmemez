Convert your meme to an nft on Zora, then cast it to the memes channel on FC.

what
- Anyone may create their own edition (meme) under a multiedition (collection)
- Community Edition manager (contract) has admin rights on multiedition.
- Sales will start after creation. Until 0ct, 10. (testing purposes)
- Rewards and fees go to one of my wallets (testing purposes)

how to
1. Connect wallet (Zora Testnet)
2. Upload your meme (jpg,png,jpeg)
3. Wait until metadata is ready, then click Create button
4. Confirm transaction

The Community Edition Manager contract will create a new edition under a multi-edition, after confirming the transaction you will get the link to the minting site for your meme/nft on Zora.
You also get a warpcast link with a composed cast including the link.
(I am still managing to cast directly to the memes channel and include the meme too)

Let me know if you have any questions or if anything it is not working as expected.
Any suggestions or critics are welcome, too!
